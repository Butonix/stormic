    <b>Stormic</b> consists of three main modules:
    <br />
    <b>1.</b> Multi-blogging platform (like dtf.ru, dev.to, etc.);
    <br />
    <b>2.</b> Instant messaging system (like Discord);
    <br />
    <b>3.</b> Wiki module.
    <br />
    <br />
    How does it work? - These three modules aim to solve the problems that arise when used individually and give users tools to create full-fledged communities. Now, when you run your blog, you don't need to maintain a website and separately a Discord server or a Telegram channel to keep your community active.
    <br />
    <br />
    A few features beyond the basics (similar to dtf.ru, dev.to):
    <br />
    <b>1.</b> Users can create and administer categories and assign their moderators;
    <br />
    <b>2.</b> When a category is created for posts, a server similar to Discord is automatically created;
    <br />
    <b>3.</b> The creator of the category becomes the server administrator and can assign moderators for the server;
    <br />
    <b>4.</b> The category and server are tightly connected. It's one entity. When new posts appear in the category, information about them also appears on the server, including notifications about comments, replies, and other interactions. This allows for native interaction with posts without needing to switch between platforms. This solution keeps post comments clean and relevant while maintaining community activity on your servers. Stormic separates users who want to discuss the topic in the post's comments from those who want to share funny pictures or spam local memes. These two types of users often don't get along, and Stormic addresses this issue. Maximum native interaction within one ecosystem;
    <br />
    <b>5.</b> The Wiki module allows for writing detailed guides and documentation. This module is also connected to your server and blog module. When answering the same question for the 100th time, you can easily refer to paragraphs from the wiki article by quoting them, whether you're on the server or in the blog. This is convenient and reduces toxicity when experienced users get tired of answering the same questions from newcomers.
    <br />
    <br />
    These and other tools give you the ability to create a real, full-fledged community, all within one platform.
    Stormic emphasizes administrative capabilities for both individual communities and the platform as a whole. Blacklists for categories and users, bans, kicks, mutes, and much more are in your hands.
